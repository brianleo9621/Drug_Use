# Drug Use Pattern Analysis

## Overview
A comprehensive data analysis project examining substance use patterns across different states using advanced clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques. The analysis focuses on identifying regional trends and patterns in substance use data from 2006-2009.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning pipeline
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction
- Multiple clustering algorithms implementation
- Interactive visualizations for pattern analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- pandas for data manipulation
- scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
- seaborn and matplotlib for visualization
- numpy for numerical computations

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaned missing values
   - Filtered datasets by year (2006-2009)
   - Normalized data for analysis

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Implemented PCA for dimension reduction
   - Retained 90% variance with 4 principal components
   - Created derived features for clustering analysis

3. **Clustering Analysis**
   - K-means clustering
   - Hierarchical clustering
   - DBSCAN implementation
   - Cluster validation using silhouette scores

4. **Visualization**
   - t-SNE plots for high-dimensional data visualization
   - Heatmaps for regional trend analysis
   - Interactive dashboards for pattern exploration

## Results
- Identified significant regional patterns in substance use
- Discovered key demographic factors influencing usage rates
- Generated insights for public health strategy development
